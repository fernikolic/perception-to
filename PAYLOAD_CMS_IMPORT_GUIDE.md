# Payload CMS Import Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to import the generated content files into your Payload CMS to make the programmatic SEO URLs work live.

## Generated Files

The following files have been created in your project root:

1. **`payload-glossary-import.json`** - Contains 6 glossary entries including the crucial "bitcoin-sentiment" entry
2. **`payload-learn-import.json`** - Contains 5 learn articles including the "bitcoin-sentiment-analysis" guide  
3. **`cms-import-summary.json`** - Summary of what was generated and import instructions

## Target URLs

After importing, these specific URLs will work:
- `https://perception.to/glossary/bitcoin-sentiment`
- `https://perception.to/learn/bitcoin-sentiment-analysis`

## Import Instructions

### Method 1: Using Payload CMS Admin Panel (Recommended)

1. **Access your Payload CMS admin panel**
   - Go to your Payload CMS admin URL (usually `/admin`)
   - Login with your admin credentials

2. **Import Glossary Entries**
   - Navigate to Collections > Glossary (or equivalent)
   - Look for Import/Bulk Import option
   - Upload `payload-glossary-import.json`
   - Verify 6 entries were imported successfully

3. **Import Learn Articles**
   - Navigate to Collections > Learn (or equivalent)
   - Look for Import/Bulk Import option  
   - Upload `payload-learn-import.json`
   - Verify 5 articles were imported successfully

4. **Verify URLs**
   - Test: `/glossary/bitcoin-sentiment`
   - Test: `/learn/bitcoin-sentiment-analysis`
   - Both should now show content instead of "Term Not Found"

### Method 2: Programmatic Import (Alternative)

If your Payload CMS doesn't have a UI import feature, you can use the API:

```javascript
// Example import script
const payload = require('payload');

async function importContent() {
  await payload.init({
    secret: process.env.PAYLOAD_SECRET,
    mongoURL: process.env.DATABASE_URI,
    local: true,
  });

  // Import glossary entries
  const glossaryData = require('./payload-glossary-import.json');
  for (const entry of glossaryData.docs) {
    await payload.create({
      collection: 'glossary',
      data: entry,
    });
  }

  // Import learn articles
  const learnData = require('./payload-learn-import.json');
  for (const article of learnData.docs) {
    await payload.create({
      collection: 'learn',
      data: article,
    });
  }

  console.log('Import completed!');
}

importContent();
```

### Method 3: Database Direct Import (Advanced)

If using MongoDB directly:

```bash
# Import glossary collection
mongoimport --db your-database --collection glossary --file payload-glossary-import.json --jsonArray

# Import learn collection  
mongoimport --db your-database --collection learn --file payload-learn-import.json --jsonArray
```

## Content Structure

### Glossary Entries Include:
- Comprehensive definitions
- Practical examples
- Related terms
- SEO-optimized meta data
- Market context and usage

### Learn Articles Include:
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Advanced techniques
- Case studies
- Tools and resources

## Verification Checklist

After import, verify:

- [ ] `/learn/bitcoin-sentiment-analysis` loads successfully  
- [ ] Content displays properly with formatting
- [ ] Meta titles and descriptions are correct
- [ ] Internal links work properly
