Spaces organize your intelligence by project or stakeholder (board prep in one Space, competitive intel in another).

  },

    answer: "We monitor 100+ sources across Bitcoin, stablecoins, and tokenized finance. This includes Bloomberg, Financial Times, Reuters, crypto-native media like CoinDesk and The Block, social platforms, regulatory announcements, and more. Every trend we cluster, every watchlist alert, every Recipe output is backed by comprehensive source coverage."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from news aggregators or ChatGPT?",
    answer: "News aggregators just show you articles. ChatGPT requires you to manually input context and doesn't cite sources. Perception monitors everything automatically through watchlists, organizes it in Spaces, and generates professional deliverables with Recipes. All with full source citations. It's a complete intelligence workspace, not a search tool."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize what I track?",

  },
  {
    question: "What if I need strategic advisory beyond the platform?",

  },
  {
    question: "Can I provide feedback or request features?",
    answer: "Absolutely. The platform has built-in feedback mechanisms. We're building this for professionals who need to create deliverables efficiently, and we actively incorporate user input. We stay focused on making the Watchlists, Spaces, and Recipes workflow as powerful as possible."
