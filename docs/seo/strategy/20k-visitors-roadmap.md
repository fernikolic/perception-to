## Traffic Math

To reach 20,000 visitors/month from organic search:

| Approach | Needed | Realistic? |
|----------|--------|------------|
| 20 pages × 1,000 visits each | 20 high-traffic pages | Hard |
| 100 pages × 200 visits each | Content scale | Medium |
| 200 pages × 100 visits each | Programmatic SEO | Easier |
| Mix of above | Best approach | ✓ |

**Recommended mix:**
- 5 pillar pages: 2,000 visits/mo each = 10,000
- 20 supporting pages: 300 visits/mo each = 6,000
- 50 long-tail pages: 80 visits/mo each = 4,000
- **Total: 20,000**
