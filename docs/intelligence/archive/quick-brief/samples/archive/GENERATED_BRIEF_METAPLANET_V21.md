# MEDIA LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS

🚨 CRITICAL: Analyze CRYPTO MEDIA vs MAINSTREAM MEDIA separately

**Crypto Media Coverage (56 articles):**
• Crypto media covering crypto = expected, not newsworthy
• Active reporters: James Van Straten at CoinDesk, Anas Hassan at Crypto News
• Focus: Bitcoin acquisitions and financial strategies

**Mainstream Media Coverage (2 articles):**
• THIS IS THE CRITICAL SIGNAL
• Mainstream coverage exists - analyze what angles broke through
• If zero: What would make this story relevant to WSJ/Bloomberg/FT readers?
• If non-zero: Why did mainstream media cover this? What made it newsworthy beyond crypto?

**Coverage Gap Analysis:**
• Compare crypto vs mainstream focus by counting topics in article content
• Example: "Crypto media: 55 of 58 articles focus on [X]. Mainstream: 0 articles = hasn't broken through"
• Example: "Social media: 60% discuss [Y]. Crypto media: 2 of 58 articles (3%) = crypto journalists missing what community cares about"
