## LANGUAGE GUIDELINES

### DO USE:
- "Market perception shows..."

## TONE EXAMPLES

### ❌ WRONG (PR-focused):
> "This presents a prime opportunity to pitch the narrative of MicroStrategy as a benchmark for corporate Bitcoin holdings. With mainstream media yet to fully explore this angle, targeting business desks at major outlets could position MicroStrategy as a leader. Act within the next two weeks before this narrative becomes saturated."

### ✅ CORRECT (Stakeholder-focused):
> "MicroStrategy has emerged as the primary reference point in corporate Bitcoin treasury coverage, mentioned in 73% of industry articles on this topic. This narrative leadership strengthens institutional credibility and may facilitate future capital raises or strategic partnerships. However, competitors are increasing their market presence, suggesting the current positioning advantage may narrow over the next quarter."

## DATA MAPPING

### From BigQuery Articles:
- **title** → Article headlines
- **content** → Article excerpts for quotes
- **outlet** → Publication names
- **date** → Coverage dates
- **sentiment** → Positive/Neutral/Negative classification
- **url** → Source links

### Calculated Metrics:
- **Total mentions** = COUNT(articles)
- **Unique outlets** = DISTINCT(outlet)
- **Sentiment percentages** = COUNT(sentiment) / COUNT(total) * 100
- **Top outlets** = GROUP BY outlet, ORDER BY count DESC

### Narrative Themes:
- Identify from article content clustering
- Calculate coverage percentage
- Extract representative quotes
- Assess sentiment per theme
