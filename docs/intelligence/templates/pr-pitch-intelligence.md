# PR PITCH INTELLIGENCE BRIEF TEMPLATE
## Quick Brief Format for PR Professionals

---

## TEMPLATE PURPOSE

This template generates a **PR Pitch Intelligence Brief** for communications professionals.

**Audience:** PR professionals, communications managers, media relations specialists
**Purpose:** Actionable intelligence for media pitching and narrative positioning
**Tone:** Strategic, specific, tactical, immediately actionable
**Focus:** WHO owns which angles, what's saturated vs. open, specific pitch opportunities

---

## CRITICAL DIFFERENTIATION

### PR Pitch Intelligence vs. Stakeholder Communications:

**PR Pitch Intelligence (This Template)**
- ✅ Journalist outreach recommendations with names and outlets
- ✅ Specific pitch angles with timing windows
- ✅ "Pitch [outlet] by [date] because [reason]"
- ✅ Newsjacking opportunities
- ✅ Reporter targeting and relationship building
- ✅ Narrative angle saturation analysis
- ✅ Historical angle avoidance (12-month analysis)

**Stakeholder Communications**
- ❌ NO journalist outreach
- ❌ NO PR tactics
- ❌ Market perception for board/investors

---

## BANNED PHRASES (AUTOMATIC REJECTION)

These phrases are **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN** and will result in brief rejection:

❌ "Your move" / "Your play" / "Your next step"
❌ "Leverage" (in any context)
❌ "Capitalize on"
❌ "Seize the opportunity"
❌ "Move quickly" / "Act swiftly" / "Act now" / "Move fast"
❌ "Game-changer"
❌ "Position your brand"
❌ "Before the narrative becomes saturated"

**Instead, use specific actionable recommendations:**
- ✅ "Pitch Fortune's business desk by October 15th - their September 22nd article shows they're tracking this story"
- ✅ "Use the regulatory angle to pitch WSJ's financial policy desk"
- ✅ "Pitch within 3 weeks - MicroStrategy's Q4 earnings on November 2nd will shift coverage focus"

## TEMPLATE STRUCTURE

### 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Purpose:** Lead with biggest opportunity, create urgency

**Format:**
```markdown
# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

[2-3 punchy sentences that:]
• Lead with the biggest opportunity or insight
• State the current narrative positioning
• Give immediate action with clear urgency
• Make it impossible to ignore

Example: "Metaplanet is emerging as the 'MicroStrategy of Asia' narrative - and the pitch window is wide open for the next 2 weeks. Coverage jumped 45% as tier-1 outlets frame this as validation that Bitcoin treasury strategies are going global. Pitch the geographic diversification angle to international business desks before this narrative saturates."
```

---

### 2. HISTORICAL CONTEXT (12-Month Analysis)

**Purpose:** Show which narrative angles are exhausted vs. fresh

**Format:**
```markdown
# HISTORICAL CONTEXT

⚠️ **12-Month Narrative Analysis** (excludes most recent 30 days)

This section shows which narrative angles have been exhausted and which are fresh.

**OVERSATURATED** (avoid entirely):
• **"[Theme Name]"** ([X] mentions, [trend])
  - Common phrases: [phrase 1], [phrase 2], [phrase 3]
  - ⛔ This angle is completely played out - media has moved on

**MATURE** (use only with unique twist):
• **"[Theme Name]"** ([X] mentions, [trend])
  - ⚠️ Still relevant but needs differentiation

**EMERGING** (good opportunities):
• **"[Theme Name]"** ([X] mentions, [trend])
  - ✅ Fresh angle with momentum - good to pitch

**NOVEL** (claim immediately):
• **"[Theme Name]"** ([X] mentions, [trend])
  - ⭐ Virtually unexplored - claim this before competitors discover it
```

**Rules:**
- ✗ NEVER recommend angles marked OVERSATURATED
- ✗ NEVER use phrases from OVERSATURATED themes
- ✓ PRIORITIZE angles marked NOVEL
- ✓ CONSIDER angles marked EMERGING
- ✓ Use MATURE angles ONLY with unique twist from current data

---

### 3. TRENDING INTELLIGENCE (Last 48 Hours)

**Purpose:** Identify newsjacking opportunities from breaking trends

**Format:**
```markdown
# TRENDING INTELLIGENCE (Last 48 Hours)

📰 **TRENDING TOPICS**

**Trend 1: "[Trend Title]"**

📊 **TREND DATA:**

Signal: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | Confidence: [X]% | [Y] articles | [Z]% positive

What's happening: [Summary]

Key highlights:
• [Highlight 1]
• [Highlight 2]
• [Highlight 3]

Business context: [Business implications]

Recent coverage:
• [Outlet]: "[Title]" ([Date]) [[X]% positive] [URL]
• [Outlet]: "[Title]" ([Date]) [[X]% neutral] [URL]

🎯 **CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS FOR "[TOPIC]":**
- **Convergence:** [How topic intersects with this trend]
- **Unique Angle:** [Specific angle that adds value]
- **Newsjacking Opportunity:** [Which outlet + specific pitch angle]
```

**Requirements:**
- Include AT LEAST 5 trends (preferably all available)
- Copy trend data VERBATIM (signal, confidence, highlights)
- Only fill in convergence analysis sections
- Specific outlet + pitch angle for newsjacking

---

### 4. VERIFIED DETAILS (From Articles)

**Purpose:** Ensure factual accuracy in pitches

**Format:**
```markdown
📊 **VERIFIED DETAILS (Extracted from Articles)**

💰 **From Article Analysis:**
- Financial Amount: [Exact amount extracted]
- Mechanism: [Specific mechanism]
- Key Figures: [Number 1], [Number 2], [Number 3]

🚨 **FACTUAL CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENT:**
- Use these EXACT details in all recommendations
- Do NOT approximate, round, or substitute different terms
- Cite specific data points when pitching
```

---

### 5. KEY INSIGHTS

**Purpose:** Provide strategic analysis with specific pitch recommendations

**Format:**
```markdown
# KEY INSIGHTS

**[Insight Title]**: [Finding - use specific counts from article analysis]

**So what?** [Business implication - why this matters]

**Recommendation:** [SPECIFIC action - who to pitch, what angle, when]

[Requirements:]
- COUNT articles (e.g., "42 of 58 articles mention...")
- Include article numbers as proof (e.g., "Articles #1, #3, #7-#12")
- Quote specific passages from articles
- Compare counts across topics (saturation vs. gaps)
- Extract SPECIFIC details (dollar amounts, dates, mechanisms)
- Distinguish crypto media vs. mainstream media

Example:
**MicroStrategy Dominates Corporate Treasury Narrative**: Analyzing full content, 42 of 58 articles (72%) explicitly discuss MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy (Articles #1, #2, #4-#7, #9-#48). In contrast, only 3 articles mention competitors.

**So what?** The 42:3 ratio shows complete narrative saturation for corporate Bitcoin treasury stories.

**Recommendation:** Avoid treasury angle entirely. I found 12 articles mentioning "ETF inflows" (Articles #5, #8, #11, #19-#27) but ZERO discussing "ETF tax implications". Pitch the tax angle to ETF reporters - it's unexplored with existing reader interest.
```

### 6. MEDIA LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS

**Purpose:** Distinguish crypto echo chamber from mainstream breakthrough

**Format:**
```markdown
# MEDIA LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS

🚨 CRITICAL: Analyze CRYPTO MEDIA vs MAINSTREAM MEDIA separately

**Crypto Media Coverage ([X] articles):**
• Crypto media covering crypto = expected, NOT newsworthy
• Active reporters: [Names and outlets]
• Focus areas: [Based on article content counts]

**Mainstream Media Coverage ([Y] articles):**
• THIS IS THE CRITICAL SIGNAL
• [If zero:] ZERO mainstream coverage = story confined to crypto echo chamber = major PR opportunity
• [If non-zero:] Mainstream breakthrough - analyze what angles broke through

**Coverage Gap Analysis:**
• Compare crypto vs mainstream focus with article counts
• Example: "Crypto media: 55 of 58 focus on [X]. Mainstream: 0 articles = hasn't broken through"
```

---

### 7. COMPETITIVE NARRATIVE CONTEXT

**Purpose:** Identify who owns narratives and where gaps exist

**Format:**
```markdown
# COMPETITIVE NARRATIVE CONTEXT

**Who Owns This Narrative:**
• Which companies/entities dominate this conversation?
• How is [topic] positioned relative to them?

**Positioning Opportunity:**
• What narrative angle is unclaimed or weakening?
• Why is NOW the time to claim it?
• What's the window before it closes?
```

---

### 8. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

**Purpose:** Provide specific, tactical pitch recommendations

**Format:**
```markdown
# ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

## Primary Pitch

**Angle:** [Exact framing - write like pitch subject line]

CRITICAL: Must be SPECIFIC with exact hook:
❌ WRONG: "Financial Innovations: Redefining Bitcoin Strategies"
✅ CORRECT: "Metaplanet's $1.4B Convertible Bond - First Japanese Firm to Fund Bitcoin Treasury via Debt"

**Who to pitch:**
• [If have reporter names:] "James Van Straten at CoinDesk (3 articles, positive stance)"
• [If outlet covered but no name:] "Fortune business desk (recent article: 'Title', Date)"
• [If outlet hasn't covered:] "WSJ business desk - hasn't covered this yet, pitch [angle]"
• NEVER use placeholders like "[Name]"

**Timing:** [When to pitch and why - specific window]

**Supporting elements:** [What to include - data points, angles, hooks]

## Secondary Opportunities

[1-2 additional pitch angles or tactical moves]

## What NOT to Do

• [Specific mistake to avoid - e.g., "Don't pitch as 'Japanese company buys Bitcoin' - too generic"]
• [Another specific thing that won't work and why]
• [Timing mistake - e.g., "Don't wait for 'perfect moment' - window is open NOW"]
```

---

### 9. BOTTOM LINE

**Purpose:** Decisive summary with clear action

**Format:**
```markdown
# BOTTOM LINE

In one concise paragraph: **"What should I do about this?"**

Be decisive. Be specific. Create urgency without being alarmist.

Example: "The [topic] narrative is currently dominated by [Company X] on the [angle] story and [Company Y] on [different angle]. The smart play is NOT to compete directly - instead, pitch [unclaimed angle] to [specific outlets] because [specific reason]. You have 2-3 weeks before [Company Z] claims this space."
```

---

## CRITICAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS

**DO:**
✓ Sound like experienced strategist, not report bot
✓ Be brutally specific - reporter names, outlet names, exact angles
✓ Every section must answer "so what?" and "what should I do?"
✓ Create urgency with timing windows (2 weeks, 30 days, etc.)
✓ Use data to support claims but don't lead with numbers
✓ Write in paragraphs, not bullet points (except where specified)
✓ Keep total under 1200 words
✓ Sound confident and authoritative, no hedging

**DON'T:**
✗ Don't say "the data shows" - just tell me what it means
✗ Don't use corporate buzzwords (leverage, synergize, optimize)
✗ Don't assume reader has a company to pitch
✗ Don't give advice without saying WHO currently owns that space
✗ Don't mention positive sentiment without explaining WHY
✗ Don't say "mentions increased X%" without saying WHY it matters
✗ Don't list reporters without saying WHAT to pitch them
✗ Don't be vague ("reach out to media") - be specific ("pitch X to Y with Z angle")
✗ Don't hedge ("might", "could", "possibly") - be decisive
✗ Don't make it feel like a template - make it feel like expert analysis

---

## EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

**Every insight MUST be supported by article content:**

✓ READ full article content and COUNT specific topics
✓ Example: "18 of 58 articles mention 'regulation'"
✓ Example: "32 focus on 'Bitcoin purchases', only 3 mention 'tax implications'"
✓ Include specific article numbers as proof
✓ Quote relevant passages
✓ Distinguish CRYPTO MEDIA vs MAINSTREAM MEDIA vs SOCIAL MEDIA

**CRITICAL MEDIA CATEGORIZATION:**
- Crypto-native media (CoinDesk, The Block) covering crypto = EXPECTED, NOT NEWSWORTHY
- Mainstream media (WSJ, Bloomberg, CNBC) covering crypto = SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGH

**DO NOT:**
✗ Say "underreported" without providing count
✗ Claim something is "absent" without checking all content
✗ Speculate about topics not in articles
✗ Make claims like "limited exploration" without counting
✗ Invent narrative angles - only identify angles present in content

---
