## FAQ Section

### General Questions

**Q: What makes Perception different from Google Alerts or RSS feeds?**

A: Google Alerts sends you every mention of a keyword—99% noise. RSS feeds are passive. Perception actively monitors your watchlist, identifies meaningful patterns across 100+ sources, and only alerts you when something actually matters. It's the difference between a spam folder and a personal analyst.

---

**Q: Do I need to be technical to use this?**

A: Nope. If you can add items to a shopping cart, you can use Perception. Add companies/topics to your watchlist, pick your role (BD, VC, PR, etc.), and your companion does the rest.

---

**Q: How does the "companion" know what's important?**

A: Perception uses pattern recognition, not keyword matching. It learns what "normal" coverage looks like for your watchlist items, then alerts you when things spike, drop, or shift in sentiment. Plus, your weekly reports are tailored to your specific role—what matters to a VC is different from what matters to PR.

---

### Trial & Pricing Questions

**Q: Do I need a credit card to start my trial?**

A: Nope. Start your 7-day trial with just your email. Add payment later if you want to continue.

---

**Q: What happens after my trial ends?**

A: Your companion stops watching. You'll lose access to alerts, weekly reports, and your watchlist monitoring. Add payment anytime to reactivate with all your settings intact.

---

**Q: Can I change plans later?**

A: Yes. Upgrade from Pro to Premium anytime. Downgrade at the end of your billing cycle.

---

**Q: What is "beta pricing" and when does it end?**

A: We're offering 50% off ($49 Pro / $99 Premium) while we're building out features. Lock in this price now and keep it forever—even after we exit beta and pricing doubles. Beta pricing ends after our first 100 paid subscribers.

---

**Q: What happens if I join after beta ends?**

A: You'll pay full price ($99 Pro / $199 Premium). Early adopters who locked in beta pricing keep their discounted rate forever.

---

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**

A: Yes. No contracts, no questions asked. Cancel from your account settings.

---

### Feature Questions

**Q: How many sources do you monitor?**

A: 100+ sources including major news outlets (Bloomberg, Reuters, CoinDesk), regulatory filings, podcasts, social media, regional publications, and niche crypto media. We're constantly adding more.

---

**Q: What's the difference between "alerts" and "weekly reports"?**

A: Alerts are real-time notifications when your watchlist items spike/drop/shift. Weekly reports are comprehensive intelligence summaries delivered every Monday, analyzing the full week's developments across all your watchlist items—tailored to your role.

---

**Q: What personas/roles do you support?**

A: Five personas, each with customized weekly reports:
- Business Development
- Venture Capital
- Marketing & PR (includes reporter intelligence)
- Executive Leadership
- Corporate Development

---

**Q: Can I track competitors?**

A: Absolutely. Most users add 1-2 competitors to their watchlist alongside their own company. You'll see when they're getting coverage, hiring, raising funds, or launching products.

---

**Q: What if I want to track more than 10 companies? (Premium limit)**

A: Contact us for Enterprise pricing. We can accommodate larger watchlists, team accounts, and custom integrations.

---

**Q: Do you have an API?**

A: Not yet, but it's on the roadmap. Interested? Email fernando@perception.to and we'll notify you when it's ready.
