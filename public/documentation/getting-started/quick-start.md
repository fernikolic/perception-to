Your watchlist is the heart of Perception. It tells the platform what topics matter to you.

**To add a watchlist item:**

3. Enter a name (e.g., "MicroStrategy" or "Bitcoin ETF")
4. Add search terms (e.g., "MSTR, Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy Bitcoin")
5. Click **Save**

Perception will now track all coverage matching your search terms.

## Step 2: Explore the Feed

The **Intelligence Feed** shows you all relevant coverage for your watchlist items.

**What you'll see:**
- **Headlines**: Article titles with source and publication date
- **Sentiment**: Whether coverage is positive, neutral, or negative
- **Outlet**: Which media source published it
- **Date**: When it was published

**Pro tip**: Use the date filters to focus on recent coverage or explore historical data.

Trends are updated in real-time, so you'll always see what's new.
