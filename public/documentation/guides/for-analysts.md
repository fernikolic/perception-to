## Your Key Use Cases

### 1. Market Research

**Goal:** Understand how specific topics are being covered across media.

**How to do it:**
1. Create a watchlist item for your research topic
2. Use date filters to analyze specific time periods
3. Export data for your own analysis
4. Generate briefs for executive summaries

**Example workflow:**
- Research topic: "Institutional Bitcoin Adoption"
- Search terms: "institutional bitcoin, corporate treasury, Bitcoin reserve"
- Analyze: Sentiment trends over 90 days
- Output: Comprehensive research report

### 2. Narrative Tracking

**How to do it:**
1. Check the Trends page daily for emerging narratives
2. Note how trends move from "Early" to "Strong" signal strength
3. Track sentiment shifts as stories develop
4. Identify which outlets are driving narratives

**What to watch for:**
- New entrants to a story (outlets that start covering)
- Sentiment inflection points
- Narrative bifurcation (story splitting into sub-stories)

### 3. Source Intelligence

**Goal:** Understand which outlets and authors cover specific topics.

**How to do it:**
1. Search for your topic
2. Filter by outlet to see coverage distribution
3. Note which sources consistently cover certain themes
4. Track author patterns when available

## Best Practices

### Building Effective Watchlists

| Do | Don't |
|----|----|
| Use specific, targeted terms | Use single generic words |
| Include company tickers and names | Forget common abbreviations |
| Add relevant people's names | Overlook key personalities |
| Update terms as topics evolve | Set and forget |

### Search Strategies

**For comprehensive coverage:**
```
Search: "bitcoin ETF, BTC ETF, spot bitcoin fund, spot BTC fund"
```

**For specific events:**
```
Search: "SEC bitcoin ETF decision, Gary Gensler bitcoin"
Date: Last 7 days
```

**For competitive analysis:**
```
Create separate watchlist items for:
- Your focus company
- Each major competitor
Compare coverage side by side
```

### Using Weekly Reports

As an analyst, weekly reports give you:
- Quantitative baseline for coverage volume
- Week-over-week change metrics for trend identification
- Outlet distribution to understand source mix
- Sentiment data for tone analysis

**Pro tip:** Export weekly report data over multiple weeks to build time-series analysis.

## Advanced Tips

### Spotting Emerging Stories Early

1. **Watch "Early" signal trends**: 1-2 source stories can become major narratives
2. **Track outlet patterns**: When mainstream media picks up a crypto-native story, it's gaining momentum
3. **Monitor sentiment shifts**: A sudden negative turn often precedes bigger news

### Cross-Referencing

1. **Compare narrative timing**: Which outlets break stories first?
2. **Track influence flows**: Does crypto media → mainstream or vice versa?
3. **Note regional patterns**: US vs international coverage differences

### Building Historical Context

1. **Use full date range**: Data goes back to 2011
2. **Compare similar periods**: How does current coverage compare to previous cycles?
3. **Track volume patterns**: What's normal vs exceptional coverage volume?
