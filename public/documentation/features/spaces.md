## Overview

Spaces allow you to create dedicated workspaces for different projects, clients, or focus areas. Each Space has its own watchlist, saved searches, and settings, helping you stay organized when monitoring multiple topics.

## Creating a Space

### How to Create a New Space

1. Navigate to the **Spaces** page from the sidebar
2. Click **Create Space**
3. Enter a name for your Space (e.g., "ETF Monitoring" or "Client: Acme Corp")
4. Configure initial watchlist items
5. Save your new Space

---

## Space Features

Each Space includes:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dedicated Watchlist** | Separate topics and search terms for this Space |
| **Saved Searches** | Space-specific search queries |
| **Trends View** | Trends filtered to your Space's topics |
| **Reports** | Weekly reports for this Space's watchlist |

---

## Switching Between Spaces

- Use the Space selector in the navigation to switch contexts
- Each Space maintains its own state and filters
- Quickly jump between different projects or clients

---

## Best Practices

1. **One Space per project**: Keep focus areas separate for clarity
2. **Name descriptively**: Use clear names like "Q4 Campaign" or "Competitor Watch"
3. **Review regularly**: Archive Spaces you no longer need
4. **Share with team**: Collaborate with colleagues on shared Spaces
