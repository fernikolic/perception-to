## Tips for Effective Alerts

1. **Be selective with watchlist items**: Only track what truly matters to reduce noise
2. **Use appropriate thresholds**: "High" for executives, "All" for researchers
3. **Set the right delivery time**: When you're most likely to read and act
4. **Review weekly reports**: Even if you get real-time alerts, the digest provides perspective
5. **Check your spam folder**: Add alerts@perception.to to your contacts

## Troubleshooting

### Not receiving alerts?

1. Check your email preferences in Settings
2. Verify alerts are enabled (toggle is on)
3. Check your spam/junk folder
4. Confirm your email address is correct
5. Ensure you have watchlist items configured

### Getting too many alerts?

1. Increase your alert threshold to "High"
2. Make your search terms more specific
3. Remove watchlist items you don't actively need
