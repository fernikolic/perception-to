## Brief Quality

### What Makes Perception's Briefs Different

- **Data-driven**: Based on actual media coverage, not generic templates
- **Current**: Analyzes recent data points for up-to-date insights
- **Actionable**: Every brief includes specific recommendations
- **Professional**: Written in consulting-firm quality language
- **Tailored**: Content adapts to your selected audience

### Sample Analysis Quality

> "MicroStrategy's share of corporate Bitcoin holdings has decreased
> from 75% to 60% over the past quarter as competitors including
> Coinbase and Metaplanet have accelerated their treasury strategies.
> This diversification of corporate adoption strengthens the broader
> institutional thesis while potentially diluting Strategy's market
> positioning as the definitive corporate Bitcoin play. Recommend
> monitoring competitor announcements for partnership or competitive
> response opportunities."

## Tips for Better Briefs

1. **Be specific with topics**: "MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy" yields better results than "Bitcoin"
2. **Match audience to purpose**: Choose the audience that will actually read the brief
3. **Use trends as input**: Trends already have context that improves brief quality
4. **Review and customize**: Briefs are starting points - add your own insights
5. **Generate periodically**: Run briefs monthly or quarterly to track changes
