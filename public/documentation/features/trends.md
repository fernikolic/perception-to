## Overview

The Trends feature uses AI to analyze thousands of data points in real-time, identifying patterns and emerging narratives across the Bitcoin ecosystem. Instead of reading hundreds of articles, you get a curated list of what's actually happening.

---

## How Trends Work

### Detection Process

1. **Data Analysis**: Our AI processes the most recent data points (up to 200 at a time)
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common themes, entities, and narratives
3. **Trend Extraction**: Creates 6-10 specific, actionable trends
4. **Deduplication**: Merges similar trends to avoid repetition
5. **Strength Scoring**: Classifies how established each trend is

### Update Frequency

Trends are analyzed and updated **in real-time**, so you always see the latest narratives.

## Understanding Trends

### What Makes a Good Trend

Perception's AI creates specific, actionable trends rather than generic topics.

| Good Trend | Too Generic |
|------------|-------------|
| "MicroStrategy Acquires 5,000 BTC for $432 Million" | "Bitcoin News" |
| "SEC Delays Decision on Spot Bitcoin ETF Applications" | "Regulation Update" |
| "El Salvador Adds 150 BTC to National Reserves" | "Country Buys Bitcoin" |

### Trend Components

Each trend includes:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Title** | Specific, descriptive headline |
| **Summary** | 2-3 sentences explaining the narrative |
| **Key Highlights** | Bullet points of important details |
| **Categories** | Type of trend (regulatory, capital flow, etc.) |
| **Signal Strength** | How established the trend is |
| **Sources** | Data points supporting this trend |

---

## Signal Strength

Trends are classified by coverage breadth:

### Early
- **1-2 sources** reporting
- Breaking story, single source
- Higher uncertainty, higher potential value if true

### Emerging
- **3-5 sources** reporting
- Growing story, multiple confirmations
- Moderate confidence

### Strong
- **6+ sources** reporting
- Established narrative, wide coverage
- High confidence

## Trend Categories

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Price Movement** | Market price changes, trading activity | "Bitcoin Surges Past $100K" |
| **Regulatory Development** | Legal, policy, government actions | "SEC Approves First Spot ETF" |
| **Capital Flow** | Investment, institutional activity | "BlackRock Adds $500M to Bitcoin Holdings" |
| **Competitive Move** | Company actions, acquisitions | "Tesla Resumes Bitcoin Payments" |
| **Market Sentiment** | Trader behavior, mood shifts | "Fear & Greed Index Reaches Extreme Greed" |
| **National Strategy** | Government/nation-level decisions | "Germany Sells Remaining Bitcoin Holdings" |

## Using Trends Effectively

### Daily Review
Check trends at least once daily to stay informed on:
- Breaking developments
- Narrative shifts
- Emerging opportunities

### Combine with Watchlist
When a trend mentions a topic you track, Perception connects them automatically.

### Generate Briefs
Use trends as starting points for deeper analysis:
1. Find an interesting trend
2. Click to see source data points
3. Generate a brief for executive-level analysis

### Track Trend Evolution
Trends that keep getting updated (high update count) indicate ongoing, evolving stories worth watching.

## Tips

1. **Focus on "Strong" trends** for confirmed narratives
2. **Watch "Early" trends** for potential alpha
3. **Check daily** - narratives can change quickly
4. **Use categories** to filter for your area of interest
5. **Click through** to source data points for verification
