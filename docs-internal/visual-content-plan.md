## Questions to Discuss

1. **Voiceover vs Silent**: Should videos have narration or be silent with on-screen text?
2. **Sample Data**: What sample companies/topics should we use in demos?
3. **Mobile Screenshots**: Do we need mobile-specific screenshots beyond the email ones?
4. **Localization**: Will we need versions in other languages later?
5. **Hosting**: Where will videos be hosted (YouTube, Vimeo, self-hosted)?
